## Overview
The Stock Prediction Trading Web Application Software project is a comprehensive full-stack application designed to facilitate intelligent trading decision-making. This application provides an interactive platform for users to predict stock prices, engage with a user-friendly chatbot for financial data, and access a RESTful API for raw data retrieval.

Built using cutting-edge technologies such as Python, Django, Django all-auth, Plotly, yfinance, Pandas, Numpy, and Spacy, this project represents our commitment to combining complex backend algorithms with a user-friendly front-end.



## Features

Interactive Visualizations: This feature would provide a more user-friendly approach to understanding stock data. Interactive charts would allow users to zoom, pan, and hover over data points to get more detailed information.

Real-time Stock Data: This feature would provide real-time updates on stock prices and other related information. This would allow users to stay up-to-date with the latest movements in the stock market.

User Authentication and Profiles: Implementing user authentication would allow users to have personalized profiles. They could save their favorite stocks, view their search history, and customize their app settings.

Portfolio Management: This feature would allow users to track their investments, view the total value of their portfolio, and monitor their performance over time.


## Stock Prediction App

The heart of the application lies in its ability to generate actionable buy and sell signals for specific stock tickers. The app utilizes yfinance to gather seven days of historical data for the selected company. It then uses an array of technical indicators and strategies to generate these signals:

- Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)
- Simple Moving Averages (SMA)
- Bollinger Bands
- Stochastic Oscillator
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)



## Tech Stack

Our web applicationâ€™s interface was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with backend services developed in Python and Django Framework. Our tech stack is as follows:

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Python, Django, Django REST Framework, Django all-auth
- Data Visualization: Plotly
- Data Manipulation: Pandas, Numpy
- Stock Data: yfinance
- NLP: Spacy
