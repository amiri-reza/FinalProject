## login sign up page

#### User Interface - Sign In Page:
The sign-in page of our Stock Prediction Trading Web Application Software is a testament to our commitment to user-centric design and simplicity.

#### General Styles:
The page utilizes the full height of the viewport and ensures a fluid and responsive design. A soft shade of gray (#f5f5f5) for the background offers a gentle and professional aesthetic.

#### Form:
The sign-in form is compact, centered, and easy to navigate. With a maximum width of 330px, it quickly becomes the user's point of focus.

#### Icons and Navigation:
The vertically aligned icons and a smooth navigation scroller offer a clean and efficient user interface. Overflows are handled seamlessly, providing a clutter-free navigation experience.

#### Alerts:
Alerts are conspicuous with a striking purple background (#8214a3) and white text. The bold close button provides an intuitive means of dismissing the alert.

Overall, our sign-in page provides an intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing interface.

Here's a snapshot of the Sign-In page:

![login_sign_up_page](https://github.com/Python-E03/stock-prediction-teamrando/assets/109280801/5ecb782d-6071-43ac-801c-358bab4bb322)
#### Sign In Page:
The sign-in page is primarily designed for new users to create their accounts. The neatly organized sign-in form asks users for their essential details to set up a new account. This includes typically requested information like email address, password, and often a confirmation of the password to ensure accuracy. Depending on your application, you may also ask for a username or other identifying information.

Once users fill out these details and submit the form, they create a new account and gain access to the full suite of tools our application provides.

The sign-in page also has a 'Log In' button for returning users who may have initially landed on the 'Sign In' page by mistake, ensuring they can swiftly navigate to the correct page.



## User Interface - Login Page
The login page follows the same design principles as the sign-in page, maintaining consistency in the overall application.

#### Login Form:
The login form matches the sign-in form in terms of width and padding, creating a sense of familiarity for the users. It is designed to be easily accessible, making the login process straightforward and efficient.

#### Buttons:
The two buttons - 'Sign In' and 'Log In', positioned in the upper right corner, offer easy access to both new and returning users. The buttons are visually distinctive and can be located quickly, enhancing the overall user experience.

#### Alerts:
Just like on the sign-in page, alerts on the login page are designed to stand out with a vibrant purple background. The clearly visible 'close' button allows users to dismiss any alerts easily.

The simplicity and clean design of the login page invite users to interact with the application without feeling overwhelmed, making it a breeze even for first-time visitors.

Here's a snapshot of the Login page:

#### Login Page
The login page is intended for returning users to access their existing accounts. Users are prompted to enter the login credentials they chose during the sign-up process, typically their email or username, and their password.

Upon submitting these details, users are granted access to their accounts where they can view and track specific stock tickers, interact with the chatbot for crucial financial data, and utilize buy and sell signals provided by the application.

The login page also includes a 'Sign In' button for users who have yet to create an account, offering them a quick navigation option to the right page.

Both the 'Sign In' and 'Login' pages have been designed with user convenience in mind, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free experience while transitioning between these pages and accessing the application's features.

## Features

Interactive Visualizations: This feature would provide a more user-friendly approach to understanding stock data. Interactive charts would allow users to zoom, pan, and hover over data points to get more detailed information.

Real-time Stock Data: This feature would provide real-time updates on stock prices and other related information. This would allow users to stay up-to-date with the latest movements in the stock market.

User Authentication and Profiles: Implementing user authentication would allow users to have personalized profiles. They could save their favorite stocks, view their search history, and customize their app settings.

Portfolio Management: This feature would allow users to track their investments, view the total value of their portfolio, and monitor their performance over time.


## Stock Prediction App

The heart of the application lies in its ability to generate actionable buy and sell signals for specific stock tickers. The app utilizes yfinance to gather seven days of historical data for the selected company. It then uses an array of technical indicators and strategies to generate these signals:

- Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)
- Simple Moving Averages (SMA)
- Bollinger Bands
- Stochastic Oscillator
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

## Chatbot App

To enhance user engagement, we've developed a chatbot app using Spacy and NLP. This chatbot responds to specific questions about the stock, such as volume or asset price, providing users with a conversational interface to access important financial data.

![chatbot](https://github.com/Python-E03/stock-prediction-teamrando/assets/109280801/91e972d8-7d41-4644-a7f0-e3156739e242)
![chatbot1](https://github.com/Python-E03/stock-prediction-teamrando/assets/109280801/24f59696-4400-4ba4-8f98-1c757b7e8c76)


## RESTful API
In the spirit of openness and collaboration, we've included a RESTful API in the application to retrieve raw data in JSON format. This feature enables other developers to access the buy and sell signals and use them in their own applications or analytical processes.

Here's a snapshot of the RESTful API:
