#### User Interface - Sign In Page:
The sign-in page of our Stock Prediction Trading Web Application Software is a testament to our commitment to user-centric design and simplicity.

#### General Styles:
The page utilizes the full height of the viewport and ensures a fluid and responsive design. A soft shade of gray (#f5f5f5) for the background offers a gentle and professional aesthetic.

#### Form:
The sign-in form is compact, centered, and easy to navigate. With a maximum width of 330px, it quickly becomes the user's point of focus.

#### Icons and Navigation:
The vertically aligned icons and a smooth navigation scroller offer a clean and efficient user interface. Overflows are handled seamlessly, providing a clutter-free navigation experience.

#### Alerts:
Alerts are conspicuous with a striking purple background (#8214a3) and white text. The bold close button provides an intuitive means of dismissing the alert.

Overall, our sign-in page provides an intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing interface.

Here's a snapshot of the Sign-In page:

#### Sign In Page:
The sign-in page is primarily designed for new users to create their accounts. The neatly organized sign-in form asks users for their essential details to set up a new account. This includes typically requested information like email address, password, and often a confirmation of the password to ensure accuracy. Depending on your application, you may also ask for a username or other identifying information.

Once users fill out these details and submit the form, they create a new account and gain access to the full suite of tools our application provides.

The sign-in page also has a 'Log In' button for returning users who may have initially landed on the 'Sign In' page by mistake, ensuring they can swiftly navigate to the correct page.



## User Interface - Login Page
The login page follows the same design principles as the sign-in page, maintaining consistency in the overall application.

#### Login Form:
The login form matches the sign-in form in terms of width and padding, creating a sense of familiarity for the users. It is designed to be easily accessible, making the login process straightforward and efficient.

#### Buttons:
The two buttons - 'Sign In' and 'Log In', positioned in the upper right corner, offer easy access to both new and returning users. The buttons are visually distinctive and can be located quickly, enhancing the overall user experience.

#### Alerts:
Just like on the sign-in page, alerts on the login page are designed to stand out with a vibrant purple background. The clearly visible 'close' button allows users to dismiss any alerts easily.

The simplicity and clean design of the login page invite users to interact with the application without feeling overwhelmed, making it a breeze even for first-time visitors.

#### Login Page
The login page is intended for returning users to access their existing accounts. Users are prompted to enter the login credentials they chose during the sign-up process, typically their email or username, and their password.

Upon submitting these details, users are granted access to their accounts where they can view and track specific stock tickers, interact with the chatbot for crucial financial data, and utilize buy and sell signals provided by the application.

The login page also includes a 'Sign In' button for users who have yet to create an account, offering them a quick navigation option to the right page.

Both the 'Sign In' and 'Login' pages have been designed with user convenience in mind, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free experience while transitioning between these pages and accessing the application's features.
