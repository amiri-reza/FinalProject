The user interface of our Stock Prediction Trading Web Application Software has been designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind. The main view provides an image of a vibrant stock market, giving users a sense of immersion in the trading environment right from the start.

In the upper right corner of the screen, you will find two neatly arranged buttons: 'Sign In' and 'Log In'. These buttons provide easy access to account creation and existing user login respectively, ensuring that getting started or returning to your account is always just a click away.

The design of the interface is clean and straightforward, minimizing distractions and allowing the user to focus on the task at hand - analyzing and predicting stock market trends. We've strived to make the interface intuitive for both new users exploring the application for the first time and experienced traders looking for a powerful yet simple-to-use tool.

Here's a preview of our application's user interface:
