The home page has been designed with an emphasis on clarity and ease of navigation. Upon signing in, users are greeted with a sleek, intuitive interface, built on the foundation of a dark-themed sidebar that is contrastively set against the main content area. This theme not only appeals to users visually but also helps highlight the main functionalities of the application.

#### Design & Features:
Fixed Sidebar: Positioned on the left side of the screen, the sidebar offers seamless navigation through the application. It contains links to the different parts of the application, such as the stock prediction tool, chatbot, and the API documentation. It maintains its position when the user scrolls, ensuring the links are accessible at all times.

#### Main Content Area:
The main content area is where the application's functionalities are displayed. It adjusts according to the user's navigation choices, dynamically updating to show the selected feature's content.

#### Responsive Design:
The application's design is responsive, making it accessible and user-friendly on devices of all sizes, from desktop computers to mobile devices.

On the home page, users can access a quick overview of the stock market's current status, which is represented visually for intuitive understanding. They can then delve deeper by accessing the specific features from the sidebar:

#### Stock Prediction Tool:
This tool allows users to select specific stock tickers to view buy and sell signals generated by our prediction algorithms.

#### Chatbot:
Users can interact with the chatbot to obtain specific stock information like volume or asset price in a user-friendly manner.

In summary, the home page of our application has been carefully designed to offer users an immersive, easy-to-navigate interface that enhances the overall user experience while providing quick access to all the robust features of our Stock Prediction Trading Web Application Software.
